My name is Sergio Mora. I am a senior data analyst at Vanguard, working on becoming a data scientist soon. My background is in Economics with a focus on econometrics. I love working with data. I think data-driven decisions are the future of commerce thus the reasons I am studying so much about it. Also working in AI/ML means I will be spared when robots take over the world.
