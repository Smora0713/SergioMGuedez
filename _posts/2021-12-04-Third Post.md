**what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do**

Not a huge amount has changed about what I believe a data scientist does. I do still beleive that at it's core a data scientist is someone who can ask the questions that no one else is thinking about base on the data (s)he observes.
I believe I have this strong believe on what a data scientist does because I have for many years worked closely with this in my career.
Because of my close association with data scientist is a major part why I decided to study statistics.
Although my background (undergrad) is in economics I knew that a strong foundation in statistics would help me advance in the data science world.

**what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?**

I think R is one of the most specialized tool when it comes to Data Science. I have utilized R before but now that I use it for work I keep facing issues that are better resolved with other languages (e.g.python or SQL).
I believe that once data is sourced, and cleaned, and depending on the size of the data, R is one of the best tools for data analytics and data science.

**what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?**

I have had the great luck that what I learn at NCSU I have been able to apply in my career. When I took intro to SAS I was able to bring that to my old job analyzing data.
When I learned advanced SAS I was able to automate myself out of a job and into a better opportunity.
Now that I am learning R I have been able to do some awsome predictive analysis for my company and now with R Shiny I might be able to build some amazing dashboard.
