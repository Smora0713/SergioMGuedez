What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

A data scientist, at its core, is someone who can ask the questions that no one else is thinking about based on the data (s)he observes. These questions might be big or small and their impact can also vary in size. The consistent aspect of these questions is that they are driven by the data itself. For this, a data scientist must also understand the business and the meaning of the data. 

	The major duties of a data scientist are to keep a pulse on the data and how it relates to the business's actions. For this, data scientists must have a clear understanding of how to mine, wrangle, analyze, and visualize data. These are very technical skills often requiring multiple programming languages. Also, softer skills such as understanding the business needs. This will often come from clear communication with the business. Ultimately being able to “tell the story”, I’ve often heard that with data “it’s not what you know it’s what you can explain that’s important”. I think this is seen with data scientists. Having strong skills in math/statistics is pivotal not only to perform advanced analysis but also to explain the results clearly.

	Data scientists are will almost always need some background in statistics. However, statisticians can get away with little to no background in data science. Although this is changing in a data-driven world. Data science to me seems like the natural evolution of statisticians. There will always be niche groups of “pure” statisticians who can focus on theory more than practice. This group, in my opinion, will quickly diminish.

	As a data analyst for multiple years now, I am to be a true data scientist. To be able to ask the important questions not to be tasked with answering them. As someone who has worked his entire adult career in finance, I have “substance Expertise”. I am still working on my Math and Statistical knowledge, where currently I can perform some advanced analysis but still struggle to simplify it to a broad audience. My biggest weakness still is my “hacking skills”. I would consider myself very proficient in SAS and SQL, I hope that with greater knowledge of R and Python I will be able to become a data scientist soon.
